This Python script is a comparison and data extraction/reporting tool, specifically designed for semiconductor testing or test data analysis workflows. It performs the following high-level tasks:

 - Compare two text files (like logs before and after Sort-1 or Sort-2 test flows).

 - Highlight and document the differences line-by-line in an Excel report.

 -Extract and analyze related data from an MDUT log and an Excel TRD file.

 -Generate a detailed, color-formatted Excel report showing:

     -Line differences

     -MDUT register mappings

     -Matched TRD test names
